This file will provide you with a brief description of FreSMS and instructions
on how to install FreeSMS.

Since it's development in 2003, FreeSMS has successfully offered educational organizations
an easy to use and effective facility to manage courses, teachers and students.
FreeSMS provides the following features:

 - Manage courses within a class environment
 - Sopport for profile based management: Administrator, Teacher and Student
 - Online teacher and student registration
 - Allow students to self manage class enrollment
 - Allow teachers to manage student attendance
 - Ability for students to submit course evaluations

From a technical perspective FreeSMS is based on PHP4 and requires a MySQL database. This 
demonstration site has been tested on: <br> 

 - Apache 1.3.33 (<a href="http://www.apache.org">www.apache.org</a>)
 - PHP 4.3.9 (<a href="http://www.php.net">www.php.net</a>)
 - MySQL 4.1.7 (<a href="http://www.mysql.com">www.mysql.com</a>)

In order to install FreeSMS, please follow the following instructions:

1. Download FreeSMS: 
====================
FreeSMS can be downloaded at http://sourceforge.net/projects/freesms/.

2. Extract FreeSMS: 
===================
Now that you have a zip file, you need to extract it a directory in the 
path of your web server root (or have an alias setup). For example if 
the path to your web server's document root is "C:\www" than you need
to create a folder "C:\www\freesms" and extract all the files into that 
directory. 

3. MySQL Server Database Setup:
===============================
The first step required is to setup the MySQL database for FreeSMS
usage. I personally prefer MyPhpAdmin, you can download it at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/. Using MyPhpAdmin craete a databse 
called 'crcdb'. Using MyPhpAdmin's SQL window open the sql script file
crc_database_setup.sql located in the mysql directory and modify line 27, 28 
and 33 to suit the username and password to manage FreeSMS.  After modifying 
your user information, run the script. Me sure to run the SQL script against 
the 'crcdb' database. You should now have a working database for FreeSMS.

The database setup is now done, we now need to proceed to setup
the FreeSMS configuration script(s) as pere the next instruction
below. 

4. Configure PHP Script:
========================
We now need to setup the primary configuration file that FreeSMS
requires to successfully administer the application. In the directory
"[Install Directory]/classes/" you fill find a file crc_constants.mod.php. 
Open this file and modify lines 19, 20, 22 and 23 to reflect the connection
parameters that needs to be used when FreeSMS interacts with the MySQL database.

Once thie file has been modified approprietly, you can now use one of the links
below to login into FreeSMS, enjoy!
